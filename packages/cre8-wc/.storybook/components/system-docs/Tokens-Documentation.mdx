# cre8 Design Tokens

Design Tokens are a powerful concept in design systems that help ensure consistency and flexibility across various platforms and products. They serve as the atomic units of design and code, containing values like colors, typography, spacing, and more. By centralizing these values, teams can maintain a cohesive visual identity.

cre8 manages its design tokens with a separate package, `@cre8/cre8-design-tokens`, and consumes these for its component usage.

For full details regarding existing tokens, token construction, and more please refer to the cre8 Design Token Storybook in the left sidebar or visit [cre8 Design Token's Storybook](https://git.express-scripts.com/pages/ExpressScripts/cre8-design-tokens/) directly.
